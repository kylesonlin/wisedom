# Wisedom Platform Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to separate the Wisedom platform into two distinct applications:
1. Marketing/Sales Site (wisedom.ai)
2. Application Dashboard (app.wisedom.ai)

## Current Structure
```

## Route Verification Results

### Marketing Site Routes
- ✅ Homepage (/)
- ✅ All routes verified and working

### App Routes
- ✅ Authentication routes (/auth/*)
- ✅ Dashboard routes (/dashboard, /new-dashboard)
- ✅ Settings routes (/settings/*)
- ✅ Feature routes (/rolodex, /tasks, /import, /integrations)
- ✅ Test routes (/test/*)

## Next Steps
1. Clean up old files and directories:
   - Remove original marketing/ directory
   - Remove original app/ directory
   - Clean up any unused configuration files
2. Archive old deployment configurations:
   - Archive original vercel.json
   - Archive original next.config.js
   - Archive original package.json

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Directory Restructuring): 1 day
- Phase 2 (Configuration Updates): 1 day
- Phase 3 (Testing): 1 day
- Phase 4 (Deployment): 1 day
- Phase 5 (Post-Deployment): 1 day

Total estimated time: 5 days

## Notes
- Keep backups of all files before making changes
- Test thoroughly before deploying
- Update all documentation after completion
- Ensure all team members are aware of the new structure
- All routes have been verified and are working correctly
- No broken links were found in either application
- Both applications are running successfully on their respective ports
- Deployment configurations are properly set up
- DNS and SSL configurations are in place
